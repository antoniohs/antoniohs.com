The secret to a successful and productive day isn’t a complex life hack, a new productivity app, or a 5-hour-long protocol that only rich people without a real job can afford to do. Nothing is so simple. But one thing that you can do is align yourself to have a successful day by starting it with a small win.

The idea is straightforward: **start your day by accomplishing something you must do, every single day**. This isn't about adding more to your plate. It's about tackling a non-negotiable task first, creating a powerful sense of accomplishment that fuels you for the rest of the day.

And it doesn’t matter if it’s not “business-related”. We idealize the strict separation between personal life and work, but both have a huge influence on how the other goes.

What is my small win? 7 a.m. sharp, non-negotiable, it’s gym time. Of course it is painful the first few days, but once you get used to it (and after the mandatory and non-negotiable as well 7 to 8 hours of sleep), going to work at 8.30 or 9 a.m. knowing that you have already done your homework in the health and longevity department is priceless and has a huge impact on the mood for the rest of the day.

This "win" doesn't have to be a workout. It can be anything that is important to you and requires a degree of discipline. But seriously: exercise is hugely important. And weight lifting, if you are reaching your 40s and beyond, is almost mandatory.

In any case, before the emails start flooding in, before the demands of work and family take over, you've already secured a win. You've invested in yourself. This small, consistent act of morning discipline can radically change the trajectory of your days, leading to more focus, more confidence, and a greater sense of control.

Seriously, **start your days with a win**.
