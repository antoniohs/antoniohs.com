In the rapidly evolving world of technology, there is a constant demand for individuals who possess cutting-edge technical skills. From software engineers to data scientists, we are in high demand and, as a result, we enjoy the privilege of choice when it comes to selecting our workplace.

Whilst compensation and career growth are important factors in why we choose to perform a specific job, personal realization and fulfilment is not only about money. That is why I encourage tech professionals to prioritize companies that have a clear and meaningful mission, specially the ones focused on creating equal opportunities and preserving a healthy ecosystem. Here's why:

1. **Shared Prosperity:** When there is less inequality, the world becomes a better place for everyone. By supporting companies that actively work to bridge the gap between different socioeconomic groups, you contribute to shared prosperity, which ultimately benefits us all, including our families and future generations.

2. **Stronger Communities:** A more equal society leads to stronger communities, with better access to resources and opportunities for everyone. By using your technical skills to promote equal opportunity, you help create a more resilient and supportive environment for people from all walks of life.

3. **Enriched Personal Lives:** When we contribute to the betterment of the world around us, it not only impacts the lives of others, but also enriches our own. Working towards a more equitable society can provide a sense of accomplishment and personal satisfaction, knowing that you are making a tangible difference.

4. **Greater Sense of Purpose:** Aligning your skills with a company that strives to make a positive impact on the world can provide a strong sense of purpose and fulfilment. This, in turn, can lead to increased job satisfaction and motivation.

5. **Holistic Growth:** Working with a mission-driven company allows for growth not only in your professional capacity, but also in your personal values and beliefs. This holistic development can lead to a more well-rounded and balanced life.

6. **Collaborative Environment:** Companies that prioritize their mission tend to attract like-minded individuals who share the same passion for making a difference. This creates a collaborative and supportive work environment, fostering innovation and creativity.

7. **Long-term Impact:** By contributing your skills to a mission-driven organization, you have the opportunity to create a lasting, positive impact on society. This sense of accomplishment can be truly rewarding and unmatched by purely profit-driven endeavours.

8. **Attractiveness to Future Employers:** Showcasing your commitment to a company's mission on your LinkedIn profile can be an attractive quality to future employers. It demonstrates your ability to prioritize values, work collaboratively, and contribute to something greater than yourself.

9. **Happiness Beyond Income:** Whilst income does play a role in overall happiness, its impact diminishes after a certain threshold. Once our basic needs are met and a certain level of financial security is achieved, additional income does not translate to a proportional increase in happiness. By choosing to work with mission-driven companies that prioritize equal opportunity and positive impact over excessive wealth accumulation, tech professionals can seek a more fulfilling and purposeful career path. This may ultimately lead to greater happiness and well-being for themselves and their families. Embracing a broader perspective on success, one that goes beyond income, can lead to a more balanced, meaningful, and happier life.

10. Because if I leave the list having just 9 points, my OCD would kill me.

In conclusion, as a tech professional with the privilege to select whom to work for, considering mission-driven companies when searching for your next opportunity makes a lot of sense. By doing so, **you can leverage your skills to make a meaningful difference in the world**, while also enjoying personal and professional growth. Remember, if you have the power to choose, make it count!
