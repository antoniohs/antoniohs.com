I believe the best engineers are driven by more than technical challenges - they are guided by a mission. This blog is dedicated to that conviction: that we can, and should, build technology that creates a positive impact, both for society and for the teams building it.

Code is at tool. AI is a tool. But the compass for any meaningful career in technology must be purpose.

Here, I share insights on building high-performance teams, architecting systems for good, and anecdotes from a 25+ year journey that evolved from a purely technical path into a purpose-driven engineering vocation.
