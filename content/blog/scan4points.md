## Transforming mobile networks for community ownership and participation

___

> A few months ago, I shared a post on World Mobile's blog about an innovative initiative we're undertaking. I am particularly proud of this product and initiative, that I led from the product and technical perspectives. That’s why, I wanted to share it on my personal webpage as well.

In a world where technology often seems to concentrate power in the hands of a few, World Mobile is forging a new path. Our mission is not just to build a mobile network, but to foster a global community, putting power back into the hands of those who use and rely on the network every day. Until now, our approach was focused on decentralising infrastructure and operation. With Scan for Points, we extend this further: end-users will perform prospect research, creating a truly community-driven experience.

## Shifting Ownership Paradigm with World Mobile

World Mobile challenges the traditional ownership structure of mobile networks.

It’s revolutionising the mobile network industry by shifting the paradigm of ownership from large corporations to local communities. It's not just about providing a service; it's about giving power back to the people, ensuring they have a say and stake in their local infrastructure.

The core of our approach is the belief that everyone, regardless of where they live or what their circumstances are, should have access to reliable, affordable connectivity. This conviction has led us to design and implement a decentralised mobile network where communities are at the centre of ownership. By decentralising the infrastructure, we ensure that the rewards – both financial and operational – are shared among the people who truly need and use the network.

But we didn't stop there. We're taking our innovative, decentralised approach one step further with the introduction of the Scan for Points feature. This revolutionary concept allows end-users to directly contribute to the development and improvement of the World Mobile Network.

## Scan for Points: Community-Driven Network Development

World Mobile goes beyond providing connectivity, as it involves end-users in the development and improvement of their network. With the introduction of Scan for Points, a gamified feature, users actively contribute to network expansion. This initiative helps us identify weak spots and potential new AirNode locations in the network. This improves the network's overall performance and offers a unique way for users to participate in the network's expansion.

By integrating this prospect research element into our operations, we're moving away from the traditional top-down approach where decisions are made solely by a small group of professionals. Instead, we're promoting a community-driven strategy, giving end-users an active role in the network's development and growth.

## Shared Ownership, Shared Rewards with World Mobile

The rewards for participating in Scan for Points are not just symbolic. Users can earn loyalty points, which can be redeemed for benefits within the network, or value-added services.

This element of direct rewards further highlights our commitment to a shared ownership model, where the benefits of the network are reaped by those who contribute to its success. World Mobile is pushing the boundaries of what a mobile network can be. By decentralising infrastructure, operations, and involving users in prospect research, we're putting power in the hands of people. We're creating a network where everyone has a voice, and everyone shares in the rewards.

As we move forward, we remain committed to our mission of empowering communities and individuals through technology. We are World Mobile, and together, we are shaping the future of connectivity. In the words of our CEO, _“together, we are unstoppable”_.
