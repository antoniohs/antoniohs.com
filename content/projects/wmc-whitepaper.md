The World Mobile Chain whitepaper was the first version of World Mobile's vision:

_A shared economy model to deliver network infrastructure that would enable improvements in efficiencies of network design and operation, as well as provide a more fluid delivery of connectivity to users of a network._

As the CTO of World Mobile, I co-authored this paper, and architected the technical solution, including the blockchain integration, decentralized identity, encryption and privacy, NOC services, and more. I also created and led the team that implemented the system during the initial 5 years.
