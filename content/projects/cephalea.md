## The content is used for the description of the project
---

Cephalea was a project created to solve the problem of backing up while processing inmense amounts of data, produced by one of the subsidiary companies of my client, MFCXY Inc.

This company had a problem: The nature of the content that they produce didn't allow them to use public cloud services, and had to rely on on-premise open-source solutions, in this case, Ceph. The Ceph backup system was struggling to handle the amount of data that was being produced, and didn't allow to have the filters and processing that they needed.

As a single contributor, I was tasked with creating a solution that not only would allow them to support their current needs, but also to be able to scale to the future. It has been running since June 2019. In the contract conditions, we agreed that by 2026 I would be allowed to open-source the solution, so I am looking forward to it.
