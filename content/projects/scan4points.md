Scan 4 Points is the most engaging feature of the World Mobile app. It allows users to scan the networks surrounding them, and get points for discovering new unscanned hexagons in the map. The data about the network is then sent to World Mobile, using it as the first layer of information on the decision-making process for network deployment.

I created the product specification, including the user flow, gamification, and data model; as well as the technical specification, including APIs, backend services, and more. I also participated in the implementation of some backend services.
