AyA was born as a blockchain serving as the Telecommunications Settlement Layer of the EarthNode network, from World Mobile. Conceived as a Sidechain to Cardano, that served as Root of Trust, this paper was the first version of a series of future papers that aimed to generalize the solution to allow using multiple roots of trust.

After a pivot in World Mobile's Strategy, AyA was not fully implemented, but it served as inspiration for some other projects.

Here you can read the paper that I co-authored.
