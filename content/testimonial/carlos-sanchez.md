I had the pleasure of working alongside Antonio as the CTO during my time at WorldMobile. Antonio was an invaluable asset to our team, demonstrating exceptional technical expertise and an uncanny ability to quickly grasp complex concepts. His knowledge of Blockchain, DBs, architecture and cloud was truly impressive, and he was instrumental in guiding our team's efforts in the challenging but promising field of blockchain.

Antonio was always willing to lend a hand, even diving into coding when necessary to help us meet tight deadlines or overcome technical obstacles. His accessibility and willingness to share his knowledge made him a fantastic mentor. I particularly appreciated his commitment to keeping the entire team informed about the company's roadmap and goals, fostering a sense of shared purpose. Without a doubt, Antonio is a highly skilled and collaborative leader who I would be fortunate to work with again. I wholeheartedly recommend him for any technical role.
