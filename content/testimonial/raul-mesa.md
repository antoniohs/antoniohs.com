It was a pleasure to work with Antonio, a natural-born leader, charismatic, and has a special gift for management. 
 
He is well versed in agile software development, not only in code architecture, but also in systems and infrastructure. He is uber pragmatic, always thinking and implementing with the goal that everything works in a performant way. 
 
Great colleague and excellent CTO. 
 
A true leader.
