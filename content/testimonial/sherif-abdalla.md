I had the privilege of working under Antonio Hernández during his tenure as CTO at World Mobile Group. Antonio is an inspiring leader with an extraordinary strategic vision that shaped not only the company’s direction but also the way teams approached their work. He had a unique ability to align technical innovation with business goals, creating products that set new industry standards and delivered meaningful impact.

Antonio’s mentorship and leadership were instrumental in my growth as a team lead. His guidance encouraged me to think strategically, tackle challenges with confidence, and lead my team with purpose. Antonio’s vision extended far beyond day-to-day operations—he inspired everyone around him to see the bigger picture and work toward shared success.

His leadership and influence were widely recognised both within the organisation and across the broader industry. Antonio’s ability to combine strategic thinking with an inspiring approach to leadership makes him an exceptional visionary, and I wholeheartedly recommend him to any organisation seeking transformational leadership.
