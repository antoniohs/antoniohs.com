## Acting CPO

During a pivotal transition period, I stepped into the Acting CPO role to steer the company's product strategy, delivery, and innovation. I led the successful implementation of a new, holistic product development framework that significantly increased cross-departmental collaboration and aligned our product roadmap more closely with market and user needs.

Championed a new product development approach that unified the Engineering, Design, and Marketing teams, fostering a more collaborative and efficient environment.

Drove stakeholder engagement and integrated critical user feedback into the product lifecycle, resulting in measurably higher user adoption and satisfaction.
