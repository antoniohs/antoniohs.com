## Deputy General Manager

Following my success as CTO, I was promoted to Deputy General Manager, working directly alongside the CEO to guide the company's strategic expansion. In this executive role, I was tasked with stabilizing the company's core product and its teams, successfully setting the stage for our next phase of growth.

Spearheaded the company's diversification strategy, overseeing the development of new products and leading the creation of new, specialized technical teams to support these initiatives.

Focused on implementing rapid, iterative development cycles for new projects to accelerate time-to-market and maintain a competitive edge.
