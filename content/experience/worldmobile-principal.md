## Principal Backend Engineer & Strategic Technology and Product Advisor

In this strategic role, I returned to hands-on development to lead the refactoring and creation of new mission-critical systems, architecting high-performance, high-concurrency distributed systems in Go.

Beyond coding, I serve as a key advisor on strategic technology and product initiatives, leveraging my expertise to guide the company's long-term vision and growth. This includes:

- Providing strategic guidance and mentorship to the CTO and Product departments.
- Identifying and analyzing emerging technologies and market trends to inform strategic decisions.
- Mentoring leadership on technical best practices, effective team management, and scalable product development processes.
- Forging and supporting key technical partnerships to expand our sharing economy and enhance product capabilities.
- Political representation of the company in front of Spanish speaking governments and regulators.
