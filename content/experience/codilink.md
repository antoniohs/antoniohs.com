## Senior Backend Developer & Analyst

At Codilink, I joined a pioneering company at the forefront of mobile marketing, developing one of the UK's early QR code promotional voucher systems.

As a senior technical leader, I was entrusted with one of the company's key accounts, where I was the lead developer responsible for the core infrastructure. My role was pivotal in ensuring the security, scalability, and success of the platform.

- **Lead Developer & Architect:** I led the design and implementation of the project's secure and scalable backend systems, taking full ownership of the technical architecture for a key company account.
- **Hands-On Engineering:** I engineered the core backend functionalities using PHP and Java, while also managing the complete database lifecycle, including advanced MySQL administration and replication.
- **Security & Reliability:** I was responsible for conducting comprehensive security audits to ensure the integrity and safety of the platform and its data.
