## CTO & Lead Developer

I was recruited for a focused, one-year engagement to lead a complete technical and cultural transformation of the Euromillions.com platform. The primary challenge was to overhaul a complex legacy codebase inherited from an outsourced team and establish a new standard for technical excellence.

My mission was to drive a rapid turnaround and build a strong foundation for the platform's future growth. Key achievements included:

- **Platform Modernization:** Spearheaded the adoption of modern software development best practices, including Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), TDD, and continuous deployment. This initiative resulted in dramatic improvements to platform performance, reliability, and quality.
- **Team Building & Mentorship:** Built a new, robust in-house technical and artistic team from the ground up, replacing the previous outsourced model. I personally mentored the team, empowering them with modern software development and DevOps methodologies.
