## My first experience as a co-founder

In 1999, alongside two university colleagues, I co-founded Perception Technologies with an ambitious vision: to build web-based applications that would revolutionize the local industry, inspired by pioneering digital studios like DoubleYou. We established a hybrid model, developing our own proprietary products while sustaining the business through strategic consulting for local clients.

We successfully developed a portfolio of innovative products. However, when the dot-com bubble burst—a challenge felt acutely in Spain after the Terra debacle—we adapted to the new market reality. With venture capital becoming scarce, we strategically pivoted the company to focus entirely on our consultancy services, ensuring its resilience and continued growth.

As the full-stack lead developer, I architected and built solutions using the core technologies of the era, including ASP, VisualBasic, PHP, and ActionScript. This foundational experience was about more than just code; it was an immersion in business strategy, product design, and the necessity of a pragmatic, customer-centric approach.

In 2004, this chapter culminated in my first successful exit when I sold my stake to a new partner. I'm proud that the company continues to thrive today under the leadership of an original co-founder—a testament to the solid foundation we built.
