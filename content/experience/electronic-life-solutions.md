## CTO & Lead Developer

When Electronic Life Solutions approached me to join as their CTO, I was immediately drawn to the demanding technical requirements of the role: building high-performance, scalable, and secure systems for real-time video streaming and payments.

My focus on the complexity of the technical challenge was so complete that it wasn't until the final stages of the hiring process that I discovered the specific industry they operated in. While unexpected, my philosophy until then had been that a fascinating and difficult technical problem is worth solving, regardless of the domain.

As CTO, I embraced the challenge and directed all technology and creative operations for the company. My responsibilities included managing the technical and artistic teams, defining the technology roadmap, and overseeing the end-to-end development and maintenance of all digital products.
