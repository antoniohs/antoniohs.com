## CTO & Lead Developer

I was recruited by the founders as a senior backend developer and, within two months, was appointed by the outgoing CTO to be his successor.  This was a pivotal moment that defined my path as the “accidental CTO” — a leader who naturally steps up to take ownership of complex technical challenges.

As CTO and lead developer, I immediately led the platform's critical transformation into an open, event-source REST API. This was a strategic imperative, directly addressing the business team's need for constant historical data projections and unlocking new integration capabilities.

My role was deeply hands-on, encompassing both technical innovation and team leadership. I built and mentored a high-performing team, personally training them in methodologies like Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Event Sourcing.

Although the project concluded due to funding constraints, its true legacy was the highly skilled and resilient team we formed. I'm proud that I was able to bring many of these talented individuals with me to subsequent ventures — a testament to the strong, collaborative culture we created.
