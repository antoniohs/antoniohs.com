## Backend Developer and Database Administrator

After a successful exit from my first venture, I deliberately sought a role to deepen my expertise in backend systems. This led me to Vespito, a local consultancy and the official Spanish partner for MySQL.

During my time there, I specialized in engineering robust backend systems using PHP and earned my official MySQL administrator certification.

More importantly, this role was an opportunity to drive technical evolution from within. I identified key areas for improvement and championed the adoption of modern software engineering practices. I successfully introduced the company's leadership to the value of:

- Version Control Systems for collaborative and reliable development.
- Unit Testing to ensure code quality and stability.
- Software Design Patterns to build more scalable and maintainable systems.

This was also my first immersion into a fully remote environment, where I mastered the discipline and communication skills essential for effective distributed workâ€”long before it became a global standard.
