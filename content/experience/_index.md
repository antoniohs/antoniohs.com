I am a startup native at heart. My career spans over 25 years in software development, rooted in the dynamic, fast-paced world of startups—from co-founding Perception Technologies in 1999 to, most recently, World Mobile in 2018.

This journey has been one of profound evolution. It began with a focus on pure technical execution and driving commercial success, but has since shifted to a more purpose-driven mission: leveraging technology to create a tangible, positive impact on nature and society.

This path has consistently led me to leadership. I've often called myself "_the accidental CTO_", not because I ever sought the title, but because my focus has always been on taking ownership, solving the hard problems, and naturally guiding teams toward a common goal.

Today, the role is secondary to the mission. Whether as a CTO, a manager, or a hands-on individual contributor, my driving force is to apply my experience to projects that matter—those that aim to leave the world better than we found it.
