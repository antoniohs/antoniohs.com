## CTO & Co-Founder

As a co-founder and hands-on CTO, I architected and built a cutting-edge telecommunications ecosystem from the ground up. My work focused on integrating Decentralized Ledgers (DLTs), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and advanced encryption to ensure unparalleled customer security and privacy.

- **Team Building & Leadership:** Built and led a high-performing, global team of over 30 engineers, leveraging my professional network to attract top talent. I established and supervised the IT, Information Security, and QA departments, ensuring strategic alignment across all technical functions.
- **Strategic Execution:** Spearheaded the development of our core blockchain system, collaborating with leading experts and software architects. I also successfully negotiated contracts with and managed several outsource and augmentation partners to scale our development capabilities effectively.
- **Public Engagement & Vision:** Served as a key public-facing voice for the company, presenting technical advancements and strategic initiatives to our community, investors, and partners through Twitter Spaces, YouTube interviews, and live events. I excelled at translating complex technical concepts into accessible language to drive stakeholder engagement.
- **Operational Management:** Managed the Spanish subsidiary, World Mobile Labs, overseeing all local operations.
