## CTO & Lead Developer

Recruited by a former co-founder, I joined this new venture as its first CTO and Lead Developer. I led the complete architectural transformation of the initial MVP, evolving it into a highly scalable and robust commercial product.

- **Technical Leadership:** Architected and executed the migration from a monolithic codebase to a modern, modular, service-oriented architecture, setting a new industry standard for handling high-traffic loads.
- **Process & Methodology:** Implemented Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD), which significantly enhanced the platform's maintainability, performance, and reliability.
- **Team Scaling:** Grew the development team from an initial two-person unit to a high-performing team of 14 engineers, developers, and designers.
- **Product Innovation:** Bridged the gap between technology and product by designing and implementing some of the platform's most sought-after gamification features.
- **Agile Transformation:** Championed the adoption of Agile methodologies, primarily Scrum, and became a certified Scrum Master to ensure our processes were efficient and effective.

At the end of my tenure as CTO, amateur.tv was the number one video platform in Spain, and one of the top three Spanish-speaking ones in the world.
